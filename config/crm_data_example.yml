# Create a crm_data.yml file (or rename this one!) formatted just like this one and fill in the fields with your specific values.

# The 'token' value is the API key that is provided to each BatchBook account. This is the main bridge between the app and your BatchBlue data.

# The 'per_request' value is the maximum number of objects you wish to retrieve per request on collection requests. A very high number may cause requests to time out.

# The 'ra_feed_url' value is the feed URL for recent activities used in the log_activities rake task. Only necessary case you use the rake task.

# The 'caching' value refers to data caching in the application. If you just want it disabled, just leave with with a 'disabled' value.
# Case you do want it enabled, you can specify which classes should get a lazy caching (faster, less consistent) and those who get eager caching (slower, more consistent)
# Be sure to separate the class names with a comma.
